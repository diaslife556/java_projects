# 2026 - Object Oriented Programming Projects in Java

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I showcase my skills in object oriented programming throughout my college course completed during my time at the University of Applied Sciences in Zagreb 10/2025-02/2026. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with various Java functions/methods, essential libraries such as List, Serializable, Exception, LocalDate and others.

## What You'll Find in This Repository:

- Java Projects: User data input, extraction, transformation, implementation of subclasses, basic exceptions...

- All tools in unison: Some classes are connected while others work for themselves to better grasp different functionalities of programming in Java.

- Case Studies: Real-world inspired projects solving business/management problems.
